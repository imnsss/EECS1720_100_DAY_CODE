# DAY10
- Still working on the extension.
- Watch the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipa58NVGs_c
- Read prof's repo
- Read https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/
- Make 3 versions from the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipa58NVGs_c that could search and count the key word ( I use "Bear" which is the same as the tutorial shows.)
