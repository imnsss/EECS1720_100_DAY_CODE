# DAY4
- Today, I added some code based on the prof's example through Processing Python mode.
- Moreover, I tried to change the cursor's style by adding a image but failed... 
- The Python mode format is a bit different from Processing itself
  - For example: The format on Processing is void setup(){} and def setup(): is Python's format.
- Quick read about the references of Python mode!
