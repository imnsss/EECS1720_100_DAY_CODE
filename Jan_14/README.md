# DAY3
 - Install Python and P5JS on Processing
 - ~~But...There is something wrong when I run the program with Python mode. I will check it later.~~
 - Nevermind! The Python mode is just for Processing 3.5.4. I was using the 4.0 version of Processing so I got an error when I used the Python Mode. I redownloaded Processing 3.5.4 and Python mode worked eventually!
