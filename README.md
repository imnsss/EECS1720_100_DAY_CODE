# EECS1720_100_DAY_CODE
This is the REPO for Daily GitHub Update (100 days of code)

### Jan 12, 2022 √
  - I reviewed some basic Processing code today...

### Jan 13, 2022 √
  - Today I reviewed HTML (learnt in EECS1012).
  - This is my first time to use P5JS editor via webpage
  - I practiced P5JS and add some code to improve the professor's example through my thoughts!
  - Moreover, I briefly looked through the reference of P5JS.
  - Everything looks good!

### Jan 14, 2022 √
 - Install Python and P5JS on Processing
 - ~~But...There is something wrong when I run the program with Python mode. I will check it later.~~
 - Nevermind! The Python mode is just for Processing 3.5.4. I was using the 4.0 version of Processing so I got an error when I used the Python Mode. I redownloaded Processing 3.5.4 and Python mode worked eventually!
